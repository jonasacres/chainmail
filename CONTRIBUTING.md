# Contributing to Chainmail

## Project status
The project is in its infancy, and is presently being specified. Major questions that we wrestle with:

 * How can we duplicate common forum functions inside a blockchain?
 * What functions are necessary to create a durable community?
 * How do we ensure the cryptographic security of the blockstore, as users extend it?
 * How do we ensure the cryptographic security of the blockstore, as users store and redistribute it?
 * How shall users extend and share the blockstore between one another?
 * How shall users discover peers for the blockstore?
 * How quickly can a Chainmail forum operate in practice?

If you think you can contribute, you probably can! Have a peek through PROTOCOL.md. Ask questions, spot problems and pose solutions. 

## Desired areas of expertise

There are some areas of expertise we can really, really use.

### Expertise we need now
The following subject areas are immediately relevant to the project:

* Community design and management
* Cryptographic engineering
* Distributed networking
* Simulation and/or mathematical modeling of networks

### Expertise we'll need soon

These subject areas may be needed in the future, but not necessarily today:

* Java programming
* HTML/CSS/JS programming for frontend development
* UI/UX design

If you can help in these areas, and if you're interested in the project, please drop Jonas a line (see "Maintainers" section), and we'll keep you in the loop.

Chainmail: A secure, distributed communications platform.

This project seeks to create a free, secure, distributed communications platform. Chainmail is a means of creating moderated forums in a fully peer-to-peer (serverless), pseudonymous, encrypted setting. The purpose of this is to create a censorship-proof discussion network that can be used by anyone.

The project is in its infancy, and we are currently establishing a draft specification. This involves a lot of careful study of existing projects, and the application of lessons-learned to the best of current-generation technology to create a distributed architecture that is likely to be able to meet these needs. The current draft specification can be found in PROTOCOL.md. Recent changes to this specification can be seen in CHANGELOG.md.

Upon completion of a final specification, our current plan is to complete a reference implementation to demonstrate functionality, followed by a desktop application that can be used by anyone to participate in Chainmail. This implementation will most likely take place in Java, with a browser-based frontend.

# Acknowledgments

This draft specification borrows generously from concepts in the Bitcoin and BitTorrent projects, as well as the Kademlia distributed hash table. In particular, the following documents have proven particularly illuminating:

* http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia
* http://www.academia.edu/3424033/BitTorrents_Mainline_DHT_Security_Assessment

Many thanks to the contributors to Tor, Bitcoin, BitTorrent, as well as the many researchers whose work has been very informative in drafting this specification.
